# fileproduction
use a tabu_embedded simulated annealing algorithm to solve the film production problem

FFD.py -> use FFD heuristic to get the origin sequence
callf.py -> call function in the mainly program
filmproduction_ip.py -> use integer programming to get the optimal solution (but only work on the small-scale data, while working on the large data is time consuming)
metafinal_data.py -> the program which generates the data
tabu_embedded_SA.py -> the tabu_embedded_SA (one kind of hybrid metaheuristic)
main.py -> the mainly program
